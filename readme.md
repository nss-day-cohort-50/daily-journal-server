1. To add tags to an entry, make a post request to `/entries` with this data:
        
    ```json
    {
        "entry": "adding tags",
        "concept": "python",
        "moodId": 2,
        "tags": [2, 3]
    }
    ```
1. Modify the front end code to send a `tags` key with the entry data when creating an entry. The `tags` value should be an array of tag id's
